## Why

Yikes, here we are again! This is the second time I'm attempting to rewrite my personal 'website' into something I like.

Some context: so far this site had been built with Vue 2 and is a bit over-engineered given that all it does is display some static information.

So, as a small PTO project, I have decided to give it a go in rewriting this into something that is better suited for static content! This will also serve as a chance for me to reconnect with some of my Software Engineering skills that laid latent in the last few years as I focused on more of the Managerial aspects of my career.

## How

After some research (on Google and ChatGPT both) I decided to either use `astro` or `vitepress` for this project but I ended up picking `vitepress` due to its flexibility and given that I already used `astro` on [my gravel cycling's website](https://github.com/rodolphocastro/br.com.gravel-alves) and already ran into some hiccups when trying to make things a bit more 'seamless' (such as having a simple modal) to provide users a more pleasant experience.
