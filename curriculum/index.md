## About me

I am an Engineering Leader with over 10 years of experience in technology, having evolved from Software Engineer through Tech Lead and Solutions Architect, and for the past years driving organizational impact as an Engineering Manager. My focus has consistently been on leveraging technology, people, and processes to deliver business value at scale.

In the last 5 years, I have led high-impact initiatives across global, cross-functional teams (spanning Brazil, India, Canada, and the US), bridging strategy and execution. From driving regulatory-compliant launches under tight deadlines, to building products from scratch and scaling them into new markets, to shaping engineering culture through inner-sourcing, observability, and agile practices - my work has consistently accelerated delivery, improved quality, and maximized ROI.

As a leader, I ensure alignment between engineering and business goals by setting clear KPIs and OKRs, promoting transparency, and creating an environment where teams are empowered to innovate while delivering predictable outcomes. I believe strong engineering organizations are built through a balance of product vision, technical excellence, and people growth. And I actively invest in all three.

My expertise lies in orchestrating engineering strategies that scale: defining architectural standards across mobile, web, and backend; establishing data-driven decision frameworks; and embedding quality and observability into the lifecycle. Beyond execution, I champion cultural transformation by fostering collaboration across teams, enabling knowledge sharing, and ensuring engineering has a seat at the strategic table.
