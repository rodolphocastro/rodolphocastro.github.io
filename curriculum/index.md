## About

I have over 10 years of experience in I.T., having gone through the journey of being a Software Engineer, Tech Lead, Solutions Architect and nowadays being an Engineering Manager, where I focus on solving problems through technology and people.

There's a misconception that IT folks tend to be introspected and somethings a bit less empathetic (who never heard a joke about it "being the user's fault", right?), but my experience tells me a different story: as far as we apply good leadership practices - motivating, engaging and driving continuous improvement for processes and people - IT folks really get out there and make a huge difference on solving our users' problems and delivering value not just to customers but adding to their own careers. Empowered and Engaged people move mountains, even if at one small increment at time!

As a leader I ensure that my teams and projects are connected to the opportunities that deliver the biggest possible value to our users, by being agile and transparent across all the different demands and areas of an Organization, ensuring that we are executing and irradiating our long-term strategies into smaller bi-weekly and quarterly increments and by perfecting our teams by providing both formal and informal qualification.

My main skills are: A complete project vision, balancing Solution Architecture (mobile, web and backend) with Product (backlog, prioritization, roadmap and vision), using data as support for decision-making (Analytics and Dashboards built on different tools and stacks) and executing strategies to ensure quality on our solutions (focusing on the right strategy, process and execution of automated testing). I seek and promote continuous improvement of teams by using an being an Agile Leader (promoting a safe place for Scrum to happen and 1:1s focused on career development and growth opportunities within our products) and the continuous improvement of our processes and an Organization for both Product and Engineering (Scaled Agile, Quarterly and Sprint Planning, OKRs, Prioritizing and sponsoring initiatives, participating in Chapters and Guilds).

## Education

### Bachelor in Information Systems - Universidade TecnolÃ³gica Federal do ParanÃ¡

Pursued a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Information Technology from 2012 to 2019. This 4-year degree provided in-depth knowledge and skills in system development, network administration, and database management, as well as expertise in designing and maintaining websites, e-commerce platforms, and mobile technologies.

Although the degree was delayed due to bureaucratic issues related to Brazilian internship labor laws, the experience offered valuable insights into navigating real-world challenges while building technical expertise. This extended timeline allowed for a more comprehensive understanding of both the academic and practical aspects of the field.

The program also included training in IT security, resource planning, and team leadership. Additionally, it involved providing consulting services for research and development initiatives, enabling the application of strategic solutions to meet organizational needs.

### High-School - Centro Federal de EducaÃ§Ã£o TecnolÃ³gica de SÃ£o Paulo (CEFET/SP)

From 2008 to 2011 I attended high school in a highly praised federal school in the CubatÃ£o city, besides the default high school curriculum over the course those 3 years I took optional classes in Software Development (using the C language).

## Working Experience

### Trimble Transportation

Working as an Engineer Manager leading Agile squads composed by Software Engineers and Software Engineers in Test, aligning expectations and roadmap with Product Managers and Business Stakeholders to ensure features were feasible within the roadmap and to suggest innovative elements to customer pains present in the market.

Coaching of individual Software Engineers to align expectations and support their career development plans starting from the P1 level all the way to the P5 level.

Planning and applying newer Engineering practices and processes to ensure deliveries were up to our quality standards without compromising our speed of delivery, including the introduction of new technologies, KPIs as well as processes such as Agile Discovery (including Product and UX) to reduce the risk of building a feature that might not generate enough revenue to sustain itself.

Drafting out, with Product Managers and UX Leads, roadmap and features that were required for new products to be created, enter a new market or attract more customers.

Using LLMs (such as GPT4 and LLAMA2) to support myself when coaching engineers or spreading information around the practices we were applying as well as creating agents that'd provide support to other Ops areas (such as PX, CX and Support itself) reducing the time needed for them to find an information they needed around the engineering squads.
