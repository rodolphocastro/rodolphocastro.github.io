## About me

I am an Engineering Leader with over 10 years of experience in technology, having evolved from Software Engineer through Tech Lead and Solutions Architect, and for the past years driving organizational impact as an Engineering Manager. My focus has consistently been on leveraging technology, people, and processes to deliver business value at scale.

In the last 5 years, I have led high-impact initiatives across global, cross-functional teams (spanning Brazil, India, Canada, and the US), bridging strategy and execution. From driving regulatory-compliant launches under tight deadlines, to building products from scratch and scaling them into new markets, to shaping engineering culture through inner-sourcing, observability, and agile practices - my work has consistently accelerated delivery, improved quality, and maximized ROI.

As a leader, I ensure alignment between engineering and business goals by setting clear KPIs and OKRs, promoting transparency, and creating an environment where teams are empowered to innovate while delivering predictable outcomes. I believe strong engineering organizations are built through a balance of product vision, technical excellence, and people growth. And I actively invest in all three.

My expertise lies in orchestrating engineering strategies that scale: defining architectural standards across mobile, web, and backend; establishing data-driven decision frameworks; and embedding quality and observability into the lifecycle. Beyond execution, I champion cultural transformation by fostering collaboration across teams, enabling knowledge sharing, and ensuring engineering has a seat at the strategic table.

## Working Experience

### MPS InformÃ¡tica (2015 - 2020)

- **May 2018 - August 2020**: Software Analyst and Architect
- **January 2017 - May 2018**: Software Developer
- **June 2015 - December 2016**: Intern in Software Development

### Universidade TecnolÃ³gica Federal do ParanÃ¡

## Tech Stack

I am familiar with the following technologies and their frameworks:

- .NET (C#)
- Kotlin (Android and SpringBoot)
- Python (FastAPI, Django, Data Science and Machine Learning)
- Typescript (Vue, React, Deno, Playwright)

As well as practices around:

- Solution Architecture / System Design (monoliths, microservices, microfrontends and serverless)
- Quality and Testing Automation (KPIs, Tools, Practices)
- Observability (distributed logging, tracing, monitoring)
- DevOps (Continuous Integration, Delivery, Infrastructure as Code, Feature Flagging, Container Orchestration)
- Knowledge Management (both at individual and team levels)

This is a non-exhaustive list and I'm continuously learning new practices and frameworks both as a hobby and as a way to improve myself as a leader within the Software Engineering industry. I believe that by staying up-to-date with the relevant trends I set an example (a "shadow of the leader") that allows my peers and team members to be inspired by.

## Education

### Bachelor in Information Systems - Universidade TecnolÃ³gica Federal do ParanÃ¡

Pursued a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Information Technology from 2012 to 2019. This 4-year degree provided in-depth knowledge and skills in system development, network administration, and database management, as well as expertise in designing and maintaining websites, e-commerce platforms, and mobile technologies.

Although the degree was delayed due to bureaucratic issues related to Brazilian internship labor laws, the experience offered valuable insights into navigating real-world challenges while building technical expertise. This extended timeline allowed for a more comprehensive understanding of both the academic and practical aspects of the field.

The program also included training in IT security, resource planning, and team leadership. Additionally, it involved providing consulting services for research and development initiatives, enabling the application of strategic solutions to meet organizational needs.

### High-School - Centro Federal de EducaÃ§Ã£o TecnolÃ³gica de SÃ£o Paulo (CEFET/SP)

From 2008 to 2011 I attended high school in a highly praised federal school in the CubatÃ£o city, besides the default high school curriculum over the course those 3 years I took optional classes in Software Development (using the C language).
